Coldfusion Elo rating system

There are a few sections where the scoring thresholds can be changed (determineRatingConstant).  For me I thought it was interesting to make the bigger moves when the competitors were evenly matched in their ratings.

Another spot to change is the starting ratings for player one and player two. 

Last is the (marktWin) I have it set to random, this can be altered (see the commented code above it).
